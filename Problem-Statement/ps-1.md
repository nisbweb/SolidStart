## Problem Statement 1: Online Food Delivery System

### Step 1 — Basic Functionality
Build a module for a food delivery app that handles **menu listing and order placement**.  
- Users can view items and place orders.
- Orders are stored with basic details like `orderId`, `customerName`, `itemName`, and `price`.

### Step 2 — Adding New Requirements
The restaurant now wants to **offer discount coupons** for certain categories of food.  
- Discounts should be applied automatically if applicable.
- Menu and order modules must be modified to accommodate discounts.

### Step 3 — Scaling and Modifications
The app must now **support multiple restaurants** with their own menus and coupon rules.  
- Restaurants can update their own menu without affecting others.
- Coupons must be applied according to restaurant-specific rules.
